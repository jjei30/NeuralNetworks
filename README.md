##Functionalities
This is mainly used to analyze the data that's contained within a csv file, then with that it determines how accurate is the Neural Network in predicting data.

The neural network types include:
* 1D Convolutional Network
* Deep Feed-Forward Network
* Autoencoder (though for this case its going to reconstruct data and then use that data for prediction)
